I was late to finish all tasks because of a nasty bug in Visual Studio, that appeared (probably) in a recent update.
When I include one project in another (as was done in tests) it seems that code analysis turns off globally or something like that and IDE becomes a stupid text editor.
I can reproduce this behavior if needed.
It took me additional time to deal with and find a solution.
Please consider this when grading.
